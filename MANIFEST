ALL students complete this section:

CHOICES
(You are allowed to choose a feature for some of the requirements. Indicate on the line
 which one you chose using the letter provided in the spec. Separate the letters with a comma
 In some cases you will also need to tell us what you did)
-------
9a. text-shadow (for page title and section titles)
9b. clamp and vw for the captions in the grid, and for the intro text when the screen is smaller than 480px
12. a (linear gradient on submit button on form), b (box-shadow for image of myself and grid items), c (transform for change theme and submit buttons)
18. b (::before/::after for page title)
19. duplicate

JAVASCRIPT
(Please tells us what the JavaScript does e.g. "click on the green button and it does the following...")
----------
I retrieved the "Change Theme" button element and added an event listener on it that listens to clicks. Clicking the button toggles the class list of the body element to include/not include dark-mode. The CSS color variables are different for light-mode and dark-mode, so the colors on the page change in response to the click.



NOTES TO STAFF
(If there is anything you need to tell us, please use the section below)
---------------
On Chrome, the link doesn't show if it's been visited, but I've verified that it changes style in Safari (I believe there was a Piazza post about this and Professor said it was okay).
